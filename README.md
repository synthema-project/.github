## Project Information

SYNTHEMA aims to establish a cross-border health data hub for RHDs where to develop and validate
innovative AI-based techniques for clinical data anonymisation and synthetic data generation (SDG), to
tackle the scarcity and fragmentation of data and widen the basis for GDPR-compliant research in RHDs.
The platform will be based on a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) network, equipped with secure
multi-party computation (SMPC) protocols and differential privacy (DP), connecting health data centres,
academic research centres, industries and SMEs to advance translational and clinical research and care in RHDs.
